    Problem 4:
    
    A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the
    product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
    
    Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
    
    Solution:
    
    Method checks palindrome by looping through and checking if the string is symmetrical
    
    Loop downwards from the maximum product of two n-digit numbers
    - if you find a palindrome:
    - check if it has two factors that are n-digit numbers
        (MISTAKE: didn't check the second factor, i/j)
